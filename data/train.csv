treatment,What are the treatments for Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis (LCM)?,"Treatment is primarily supportive care. Aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, or meningoencephalitis requires hospitalization with supportive treatment including IV fluids, pain management, and monitoring for complications.

information,What is Parasites - Cysticercosis?,"Cysticercosis is an infection caused by the larvae of the parasite Taenia solium (pork tapeworm). The larvae can form cysts in muscles, brain, eyes, and other tissues, potentially causing serious complications including seizures and neurological symptoms."
exams and tests,How is Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis (LCM) diagnosed?,"Laboratory diagnosis is made by detecting IgM and IgG antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid and serum using ELISA or immunofluorescence assays. RT-PCR can detect viral RNA in acute cases. Lumbar puncture shows lymphocytic pleocytosis."
prevention,How can Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis (LCM) be prevented?,"LCMV infection can be prevented by avoiding contact with wild mice and their droppings, using proper protective equipment when cleaning areas with rodent contamination, sealing holes to prevent rodent entry, and proper food storage."
treatment,What are the treatments for Type 2 Diabetes?,"Treatment includes lifestyle modifications (diet, exercise, weight management), oral medications (metformin as first-line, then other agents like sulfonylureas, DPP-4 inhibitors), and insulin therapy when oral medications are insufficient. Treatment should be individualized based on patient factors."
symptoms,What are the symptoms of myocardial infarction?,"Symptoms include chest pain or pressure, pain radiating to arms/neck/jaw/back, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, and lightheadedness. Presentation can vary, especially in women, elderly patients, and diabetics who may have atypical symptoms."
prevention,How can hypertension be prevented?,"Prevention includes maintaining healthy weight, regular exercise, limiting sodium intake (less than 2300mg daily), eating a DASH diet rich in fruits and vegetables, limiting alcohol consumption, avoiding tobacco, managing stress, and getting adequate sleep."
information,What is pneumonia?,"Pneumonia is an infection causing inflammation of air sacs in the lungs, which may fill with fluid or pus. It causes cough with phlegm, fever, chills, and breathing difficulty. It can be bacterial, viral, or fungal in origin, requiring different treatments."
treatment,What's the best treatment for depression according to recent studies?,"Treatment typically involves psychotherapy (cognitive behavioral therapy, interpersonal therapy), medications (SSRIs, SNRIs), or combination therapy. Recent studies show that combination therapy is often most effective for moderate to severe depression."
susceptibility,Who is most at risk for developing osteoporosis?,"Risk factors include postmenopausal women, advanced age, family history, low body weight, smoking, excessive alcohol use, sedentary lifestyle, certain medications (corticosteroids), and medical conditions affecting bone metabolism."
symptoms,What are the warning signs of stroke I should watch for?,"Warning signs include sudden numbness or weakness (especially on one side), sudden confusion or trouble speaking, sudden vision problems, sudden severe headache, and sudden trouble walking or loss of coordination. Use F.A.S.T. (Face, Arms, Speech, Time) assessment."
information,What causes Alzheimer's disease?,"Alzheimer's disease is caused by abnormal protein accumulations (amyloid plaques and tau tangles) in the brain, leading to nerve cell death. Risk factors include age, genetics (APOE gene), family history, and lifestyle factors. The exact cause is not fully understood."
exams and tests,How is diabetes diagnosed?,"Diabetes is diagnosed using fasting plasma glucose (≥126 mg/dL), hemoglobin A1C (≥6.5%), oral glucose tolerance test (≥200 mg/dL at 2 hours), or random plasma glucose (≥200 mg/dL with symptoms). Two abnormal results on different days confirm diagnosis."
treatment,What's the standard treatment for bacterial pneumonia?,"Treatment depends on severity and pathogen. Community-acquired pneumonia is typically treated with antibiotics: amoxicillin or macrolides for outpatients, beta-lactams plus macrolides for hospitalized patients. Duration is usually 5-7 days for most cases."
symptoms,What are the typical symptoms of gallbladder disease?,"Symptoms include right upper abdominal pain (especially after fatty meals), nausea, vomiting, bloating, gas, and sometimes jaundice. Pain may radiate to the back or right shoulder blade. Symptoms often worsen with high-fat foods."
information,What is irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)?,"IBS is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain associated with changes in bowel habits (diarrhea, constipation, or both). It's a chronic condition that affects quality of life but doesn't cause permanent intestinal damage."
exams and tests,How is celiac disease diagnosed?,"Diagnosis involves serologic testing for tissue transglutaminase antibodies, endomysial antibodies, and deamidated gliadin peptides while on a gluten-containing diet. Confirmation requires small bowel biopsy showing villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia."
prevention,How can osteoporosis be prevented in postmenopausal women?,"Prevention includes adequate calcium (1200mg daily) and vitamin D (800-1000 IU daily) intake, regular weight-bearing exercise, avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol, and bone density screening. Bisphosphonates may be recommended for high-risk individuals."
treatment,What are the treatment options for moderate depression?,"Treatment options include psychotherapy (cognitive behavioral therapy, interpersonal therapy), antidepressant medications (SSRIs, SNRIs), combination therapy, lifestyle modifications, and in severe cases, electroconvulsive therapy or transcranial magnetic stimulation."
symptoms,What are common signs of dehydration in adults?,"Signs include thirst, dry mouth and tongue, decreased urination, dark yellow urine, fatigue, dizziness, headache, dry skin with poor elasticity, rapid heartbeat, and in severe cases, confusion or fainting."
treatment,What is the best approach for treating chronic kidney disease?,"Treatment focuses on slowing progression and managing complications. This includes blood pressure control (ACE inhibitors/ARBs), diabetes management, dietary modifications (protein and phosphorus restriction), and treating mineral/bone disorders. Advanced stages may require dialysis or transplantation."
susceptibility,Who is at higher risk for developing skin cancer?,"Risk factors include fair skin, history of sunburns, excessive UV exposure, family history, multiple moles, immunosuppression, and certain genetic conditions like xeroderma pigmentosum. Geographic location and occupation also play roles."
symptoms,What are the early symptoms of Parkinson's disease?,"Early symptoms include tremor at rest (often starting in one hand), bradykinesia (slowness of movement), muscle rigidity, and postural instability. Non-motor symptoms like loss of smell, sleep disorders, and constipation may precede motor symptoms."
information,What is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?,"COPD is a progressive lung disease characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. It includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis, primarily caused by smoking, and leads to breathing difficulties and reduced quality of life."
exams and tests,How is thyroid function assessed?,"Thyroid function is evaluated through blood tests including TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone), free T4, and sometimes T3. TSH is usually the initial screening test, with abnormal results prompting further testing including thyroid antibodies when indicated."
prevention,How can colorectal cancer be prevented?,"Prevention includes regular screening (colonoscopy starting at age 50 or earlier with risk factors), maintaining healthy weight, regular exercise, limiting red/processed meat, avoiding tobacco and excessive alcohol, and eating a diet rich in fiber and vegetables."
information,What is atrial fibrillation?,"Atrial fibrillation is an irregular heart rhythm where the atria quiver instead of contracting normally, leading to inefficient blood flow and increased risk of stroke and heart failure if left untreated."
exams and tests,How is HIV infection diagnosed?,"HIV diagnosis involves initial screening with HIV-1/2 antigen/antibody immunoassay, followed by confirmatory testing with HIV-1/2 antibody differentiation immunoassay and HIV-1 nucleic acid test if initial screening is positive."
prevention,How can deep vein thrombosis be prevented during long flights?,"Prevention includes staying hydrated, performing calf exercises, walking periodically, wearing compression stockings, and avoiding excessive alcohol. High-risk individuals may need anticoagulation as prescribed by their physician."
